1. What is a Tuple?
A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items in Python.
Tuples can hold any type of data (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.).
Tuples are defined using parentheses ( ).
Key Characteristics of Tuples
Ordered: The items in a tuple maintain their order.
Immutable: Once created, you cannot modify (add, remove, or change) the elements of a tuple.
Allows Duplicates: Tuples can contain duplicate items.
Heterogeneous Data: A tuple can store elements of different data types.
How to Create a Tuple
Example 1: Empty Tuple
python
Copy code
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)
Output:

scss
Copy code
()
Example 2: Tuple with One Item
A single-item tuple must have a trailing comma ,:
python
Copy code
single_item_tuple = (5,)
print(single_item_tuple)
Output:

scss
Copy code
(5,)
Example 3: Tuple with Multiple Items
python
Copy code
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", True, 3.14)
print(mixed_tuple)
Output:

python
Copy code
(1, 'Hello', True, 3.14)
Accessing Elements
Use indexing to access individual elements, starting from 0.
Use negative indexing to access elements from the end.
Example:
python
Copy code
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Access the first element
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10

# Access the last element
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 50
Slicing Tuples
You can extract a portion of a tuple using slicing.
Example:
python
Copy code
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Slice from index 1 to 4 (excluding 5)
print(my_tuple[1:5])  # Output: (2, 3, 4, 5)

# Slice with step
print(my_tuple[::2])  # Output: (1, 3, 5)
Tuple Operations
Concatenation: Combine two tuples using +.

python
Copy code
t1 = (1, 2)
t2 = (3, 4)
print(t1 + t2)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
Repetition: Repeat a tuple using *.

python
Copy code
t = (1, 2)
print(t * 3)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)

Tuple Methods and Advanced Topics
Basic Tuple Methods
Tuples have limited methods compared to lists since they are immutable.

1. count()
Counts how many times a specific value occurs in a tuple.
python
Copy code
t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
print(t.count(2))  # Output: 3
2. index()
Returns the first index of a specific value.
python
Copy code
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(t.index(30))  # Output: 2
Unpacking Tuples
Unpacking lets you assign tuple elements to variables in one step.

Example:
python
Copy code
person = ("John", 25, "Engineer")

# Unpacking the tuple
name, age, profession = person
print(name)       # Output: John
print(age)        # Output: 25
print(profession) # Output: Engineer
Using * to Collect Remaining Items:
python
Copy code
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Unpacking with *
first, *middle, last = numbers
print(first)   # Output: 1
print(middle)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(last)    # Output: 5
Advanced Tuple Topics
1. Nested Tuples
Tuples can contain other tuples (or lists).
python
Copy code
nested_tuple = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
print(nested_tuple[1])       # Output: (3, 4)
print(nested_tuple[1][0])    # Output: 3
2. Using Tuples as Keys in Dictionaries
Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as dictionary keys.
python
Copy code
locations = {
    (40.7128, -74.0060): "New York",
    (34.0522, -118.2437): "Los Angeles"
}
print(locations[(40.7128, -74.0060)])  # Output: New York
3. Returning Multiple Values from Functions
Tuples are often used to return multiple values.
python
Copy code
def rectangle_properties(length, width):
    area = length * width
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return area, perimeter

# Using the function
area, perimeter = rectangle_properties(5, 10)
print("Area:", area)         # Output: Area: 50
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)  # Output: Perimeter: 30
Tuple Immutability in Depth
While tuples themselves are immutable:

If a tuple contains a mutable object (like a list), the object inside can be changed.
python
Copy code
t = (1, 2, [3, 4])
t[2][0] = 100  # Modifying the list inside the tuple
print(t)  # Output: (1, 2, [100, 4])
Performance and Usage
Tuples are faster than lists for iteration and access, making them a better choice for read-only data.
Use tuples for fixed collections (e.g., coordinates, RGB values, database rows).

Examples and Use Cases
Example 1: Returning Multiple Values
Tuples allow functions to return multiple results conveniently.

python
Copy code
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    maximum = max(numbers)
    minimum = min(numbers)
    return total, average, maximum, minimum

# Using the function
stats = calculate_statistics([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print("Total:", stats[0])    # Output: Total: 150
print("Average:", stats[1])  # Output: Average: 30.0
print("Maximum:", stats[2])  # Output: Maximum: 50
print("Minimum:", stats[3])  # Output: Minimum: 10
Example 2: Using Tuples as Dictionary Keys
Tuples make excellent dictionary keys for storing composite information.

python
Copy code
coordinates = {
    (40.7128, -74.0060): "New York",
    (34.0522, -118.2437): "Los Angeles",
    (51.5074, -0.1278): "London"
}

location = coordinates[(40.7128, -74.0060)]
print("Location:", location)  # Output: Location: New York
Example 3: Tuple Packing and Unpacking
Efficiently assign multiple variables with tuple unpacking.

python
Copy code
dimensions = (1920, 1080)  # Tuple packing
width, height = dimensions  # Tuple unpacking
print("Width:", width)      # Output: Width: 1920
print("Height:", height)    # Output: Height: 1080
Example 4: Iterating Over Tuples
You can use loops to iterate through tuple elements.

python
Copy code
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
